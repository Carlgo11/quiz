# What is Quiz?
Ever done one of those quiz walks? Those where you write down 1, X 2 on a grid paper.  
Quiz is a digital platform for this.

With Quiz you can let the players something they already have, phone tablet etc, instead of those papers that would break all the time because of the uneven surface you wrote on when out in the wild.

# How to set up Quiz

Quiz is built in two parts. One client side (called frontend), which is what the user will see, and one database side (backend) which is where the results are stored.

## Frontend
For the frontend Jekyll/Liquid is used and so to host a quiz-site you'll need to set up Jekyll with Bundler.

## Backend
For the backend PHP is used to communicate with the database (MySQL).
